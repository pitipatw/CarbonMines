Long edges are slightly\ntapers, allowing joints to be reinforced and concealed with joint tape and joint compound. CertainTeed Type X Gypsum\nBoard is available in a variety of lengths and widths.","open_xpd_uuid":"ec3xps17","resilient_flooring_thickness":null,"masonry_cement_astm_c91_type":null,"steel_rebar_diameter_min":null,"airflow_rate":null,"density":"640 kg/m³","access_flooring_finish_material":null,"flow_rate":null,"concrete_compressive_strength_other_d":null,"wall_base_material":null,"gwp":"250 kgCO2e","vrt":null,"sku":null,"asphalt_min_temperature":null,"fnd":null,"cable_trays_material":null,"pdu_outlets":null,"nsf347":null,"sog":null,"recommended_application":null,"cladding_r_value":null,"ceiling_panel_nrc":null,"plc":null,"asphalt_aggregate_size_max":null,"toughened":null,"concrete_co2_entrain":null,"thickness":null,"abuse_resistant":false,"steel_bar_elongation":null,"asphalt_gtr":null,"floor_box_cover":null,"cooling_capacity":null,"cladding_insulating_material":null,"name":"CertainTeed® Type X Gypsum Board","height":null,"cmu_weight_classification":null,"manufacturing_image":null,"energy_source":null,"flat_glass_panes_thickness":null,"residential_only":null,"wall_tile":null,"is_failed":false,"large_format":null,"product_usage_image_crop_area":null,"access_flooring_adjustable_height":null,"electrochromic":null,"mosaic_tile":null,"heating_capacity":null,"access_flooring_rolling_load_10_pass":null,"steel_composition":null,"manufacturer":{"horizontal_logo":null,"parent":null,"postal_code":"80821","primary_activity_operator":false,"email_extensions":["certainteed.com"],"confirmed_fields":[],"gwp_contact":null,"latitude":39.13127,"primary_activity_digitization_qa":false,"longitude":-103.46885,"my_capabilities":null,"pilot_all_employees":false,"primary_activity_design":false,"iso9001_certified":null,"primary_activity_performance_standards_issuer":false,"iso14001_certified":null,"web_domain":"certainteed.com","cqd_sync_server_from":null,"primary_activity_verifier":false,"address":"Paul Street, Hugo, CO 80821","confirmable_fields":[],"name":"CertainTeed, Inc.
